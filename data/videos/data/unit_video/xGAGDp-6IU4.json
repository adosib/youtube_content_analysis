Learn Java Fast launches on July 1st, 2020. Stay informed and join the waitlist: https://course.alexlorenlee.com/courses/learn-java-fast\n- In this video, I show you how to System.out.println() when first learning how to code in java! System.out.println(); lets you put text to the screen.\n\nThis series, Java For Beginners, is made for absolute beginners who have no programming experience and want to learn how to code in Java. Java is a very widely used programming language used for everything from apps to AI. Learning how to program in Java can be intimidating, but I try to break it down to help all of you new/self-taught programmers out there! \n\nCheck out the first video in this series Java For Beginners: https://youtu.be/az6SehZyY7U\n\nDo you want to learn how to code from scratch? Check out my video on How to Code for Beginners in 2018: https://youtu.be/woJb2hAfkO0\n\nNOTES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/109mnfbqleVEGxjOZ1lWLJkwnDhF9eA2R0Cu3VrjfQ9k/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOutput text, then next line: System.out.println(\"Hello world\");\nOutput text, stay on current line: System.out.print(\"Hello world\");\n\nCoding is nothing more than a to-do list for a computer. I hope to save you time and take the confusion out of coding, by teaching you helpful pieces of code you can use for your own programs.These tutorials are a way to try to help people save time and frustration when coding. I'VE BEEN THERE, it's 2018... let's make code easier, and beautiful.\n\nI hope this System.out.println() in java example was helpful! If it helped you get started coding with Java, please like this video so I know to make more!\n\nHave you used system out println before?
