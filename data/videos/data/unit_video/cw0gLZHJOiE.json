However, we'll first need to fix up our UI so that we can link the sent messages to the proper user.  In addition, I'll talk about the proper data structure to save our messages in Firebase.  We'll finally observe the messages in MessagesController to display all of our latest messages.  Quite a bit to fix but we're really starting to see how the app is coming together.
