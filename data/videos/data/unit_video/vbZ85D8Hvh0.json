In this video I show you how to use string methods in your java programs.\n\nStrings in java are just characters grouped together than you can use for printing, storing and manipulating. You can convert them to uppercase, lowercase or even get just a piece of the string by using these built in methods. I teach you how to lowercase in java and how to uppercase in java amongst a few other useful string methods. \n\nThe name \"string method\" can be a little tricky to get used to, but don't worry too much about it right now! They aren't too bad :) If you followed along, congrats!
