In today's lesson, I'll go over one of the more common algorithm challenges in detecting palindromes.  For those that are wondering, a palindrome is a word that you can spell frontwards and backwards using the same character sequence.  To make this problem a little more challenging, let's also count the occurrences of palindromes in a sentence.
