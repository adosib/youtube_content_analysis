I build out the system for a note taking app in order to test how more intricate api and database structures would work. And I also create a Flutter app to call the api and get notes and add notes via the app to the database.\nI hope you enjoy it! :) \n\n\nCONTACT: halldenkalle@gmail.com\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/kallehallden/\n\nComputer: Macbook Pro - https://amzn.to/2GX54SU\n\n\nCamera Gear:\n\nPanasonic GH5 - https://amzn.to/2Nr09L2\n\nMAIN LENS:  Lumix 12-35mm - https://amzn.to/2tzgJzp\n\nDRONE: DJI Mavic Air - https://amzn.to/2NqkQa1\n\nSecondary Lens: Panasonic 25mm - https://amzn.to/2UcTA1e\n\nSecondary Lens: Olympus 45mm - https://amzn.to/2Ebp5SV\n\nZoom Lens: Panasonic 100-300mm - https://amzn.to/2U3UH3j\n\nMonitor: AOC 27\u201d - https://amzn.to/2U6hF9Z\n\nSong:\nFresh - Ikson\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ikson\n\nAdventure - Ehrling\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ehrling", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VT8658Y91qw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VT8658Y91qw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VT8658Y91qw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VT8658Y91qw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VT8658Y91qw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Kalle Hallden", "tags": ["Coding A Social Network Platform The Startup Vlog", "how to build a social network app", "how to build a social media app", "how to build a social media website", "how to build an api", "startup vlog", "startup", "devon crawford", "python flask", "python api", "how to become a backend developer", "backend development", "backend web development", "backend programming", "python backend tutorial", "how to program in python", "how to program in python for beginners", "Flutter", "flutter database example"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Coding A Social Network Platform part 2 || The Startup Vlog", "description": "Coding A Social Network Platform part 2 || The Startup Vlog\n\n\"Clean Code Friday\"\nIf you want to receive one short email from me every week, where I go through a few of the most useful things I have explored and discovered this week.
