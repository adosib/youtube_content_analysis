Let's continue building out our video player by introducing a video duration label and a UISlider component that allows us to jump to different portions of our clip. First, we look at how to figure out the duration by inspecting AVPlayer currentItem's duration property. Converting this value into seconds is somewhat tricky so I'll go through step by step how to do this.\n\nNext we'll take a look at using a UISlider component to seek and scrub through our video.  By utilizing the zero to one value of our slider and video duration, we can use seekToTime on AVPlayer to bounce from point to point very easily.  \n\nHave fun and enjoy.\n\nCompleted Source Code\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/youtube\n\nTwitter Slide Out Menu Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Twitter-Slide-Out-Menu\n\nPodcasts Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Podcasts\n\nIntermediate Training Core Data\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/intermediate-training-core-data\n\nInstagram Firebase Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/instagram-firebase\n\nFacebook Group\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1240636442694543/\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/buildthatapp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HX1aYzaHex8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HX1aYzaHex8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HX1aYzaHex8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HX1aYzaHex8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HX1aYzaHex8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Lets Build That App", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "development", "tutorial", "learn", "xcode", "programming", "code", "uislider", "seekToTime", "avplayer", "currentItem"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Swift: YouTube - How to Seek and Scrub AVPlayer with UISlider (Ep 18)", "description": "Happy Sunday everyone.
