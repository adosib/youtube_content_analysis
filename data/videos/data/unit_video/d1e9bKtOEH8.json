The trick is to capture your anchors with a local property, and modify it's active or constant properties.  Afterwards, you can call an animation block with layoutIfNeeded to begin animating to the new properties.\n\nAnimating with constraints is especially useful to maintain view locations without having to recalculate CGRect values.
