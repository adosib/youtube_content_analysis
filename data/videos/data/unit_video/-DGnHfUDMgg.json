In today's video, let's look at how to animate some images across the screen using a curved path. \n\nWe'll be using a UIBezierPath to execute our animation.  After seeing it in action, let's also introduce some randomness to the various images that we add into our view.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nFacebook Group\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1240636442694543/\n\nInstagram Firebase Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Instagram-Firebase\n\niOS Basic Training Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/basic-training\n\nCompleted Source Code\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=1372\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/buildthatapp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DGnHfUDMgg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DGnHfUDMgg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DGnHfUDMgg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DGnHfUDMgg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DGnHfUDMgg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Lets Build That App", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "development", "tutorial", "learn", "xcode", "programming", "code"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Swift: Create Facebook Live Stream Animation", "description": "Playing around with the Facebook Live Stream the other day, I found an interesting animation that I wanted to reproduce.
