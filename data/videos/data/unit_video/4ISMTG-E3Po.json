In today's lesson, we'll go over how to use a couple of components from AVFoundation, namely AVPlayer and AVPlayerLayer, to play some video.  Along the way, I'll also show you guys how to provide some UI feedback that lets the user's know when the video is loading.  In addition, we'll be looking at how to take advantage of the cell recycle process to reset the UI.
