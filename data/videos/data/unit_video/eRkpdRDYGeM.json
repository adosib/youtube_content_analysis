Let's start implementing the ability to send video files as a chat message in our application. Because this is a really cool feature, it also involves a couple of steps to get it working properly.  In this video, I'll first show you how to properly send our videos to Firebase Storage.  When this is done, we'll look at how to grab the first frame of the video and use this to render the chat bubble.  Hope you guys find this helpful and we'll get into how to actually play our video file in the next video.
