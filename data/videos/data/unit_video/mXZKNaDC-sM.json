Check out the first part at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7uuzhDILEY\n\n\nToday we'll build a few devices using an Arduino, but it will all be done using a simulator! We'll look at how to design a breadboard layout to share with others, but also test it all on the computer! It's great if you don't have all of the physical sensors or even an Arduino at all. We'll build a few simple examples using Fritzing and TinkerCAD and look at how it can be used. TinkerCAD can be used completely in the browser.\n\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/DevDungeon\nSupport the stream: https://streamlabs.com/devdungeon\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/JWsSHJC\nGet $100 credit for signing up to Digital Ocean: https://m.do.co/c/5ccd98162d85 \nBuy my book: Security with Go https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/security-go\nWebsite: https://www.devdungeon.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/DevDungeon\nDownload Streamlabs OBS and start streaming yourself for free: https://streamlabs.com/slobs/d/13836773\nOpening music:  Song: Buzzsaw (feat.
