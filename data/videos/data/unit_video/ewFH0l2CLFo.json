Java Head First - this is to learn the basics of programming, focus on classes, methods, variables. Also Java is pretty much exactly the same as Dart which is the language used in Flutter so don't worry, if you know Java you know Dart.\nYou can buy it here if you want: https://amzn.to/2GVAdFC\n\n2. Setup Flutter - for this I would suggest checking out this article that I feel goes through the basics.

Build a simple todolist app - now it's time to build your first real app. \"Hello world\" is the classic first program to build in a language get some familiarity with the syntax.

This is more for once you have made a few apps and want to get into saving stuff from your app to the device. JSON is widely used format for saving and transmitting data. If you understand this then you will be able to work with API's and much more.
