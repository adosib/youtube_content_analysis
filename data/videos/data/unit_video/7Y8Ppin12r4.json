Things like; favourite apps, articles, podcasts, books, coding tips and tricks. Then feel free to join https://kalletech.com/clean-code-friday/\n\nIn this video I create a shell script and a python script for my terminal that will automate the process of creating new projects for me.\nI create a custom command that creates a folder, adds it to my desired directory, opens a web browser, navigates to GitHub, logs in to my account, creates a new repository, then adds the git remote to my local folder, adds a README file, does git add, and then does a commit called \u201cinitial commit\u201d and then pushes this to master.\nFinally it opens the project folder in vs code.\nI really enjoyed this one, I hope you will too!\n\nHere is a link to the project if you want to check it out yourself: https://github.com/KalleHallden/ProjectInitializationAutomation\n\nAlso I will start live streaming on twitch soon, basically doing the same things as in these one day builds but in real time, and some other coding projects.\nif you want to have a look here is a link:\nhttps://twitch.tv/kallehallden\n\nThis video is also sponsored by AlgoExpert, which is a great place to learn everything you need about algorithms. This is great if you are studying for a job interview in the field of software engineering. They teach you how about lots of different algorithms, how they work, how to use them and what their time complexities are.\nSo if you are interested then visit this link https://www.algoexpert.io/kalle30 and you will get 30% off your purchase.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONTACT: halldenkalle@gmail.com\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/kallehallden/\n\nComputer: Macbook Pro - https://amzn.to/2GX54SU\n\n\nCamera Gear:\n\nPanasonic GH5 - https://amzn.to/2Nr09L2\n\nMAIN LENS:  Lumix 12-35mm - https://amzn.to/2tzgJzp\n\nDRONE: DJI Mavic Air - https://amzn.to/2NqkQa1\n\nSecondary Lens: Panasonic 25mm - https://amzn.to/2UcTA1e\n\nSecondary Lens: Olympus 45mm - https://amzn.to/2Ebp5SV\n\nZoom Lens: Panasonic 100-300mm - https://amzn.to/2U3UH3j\n\nMonitor: AOC 27\u201d - https://amzn.to/2U6hF9Z\n\nSongs:\nGhost - Ikson\nReveal - Ikson\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ikson", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y8Ppin12r4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y8Ppin12r4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y8Ppin12r4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y8Ppin12r4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y8Ppin12r4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Kalle Hallden", "tags": ["One day builds", "one day builds adam savage", "devon crawford", "Hardest Computer Science Course Explained | Angel of Death UoG", "one day build adam savage", "kalle hallden", "kalle h\u00e5lld\u00e9n", "One Day Builds: Automating My Projects With Python", "flutter", "python projects", "learn python", "python beginner tutorial", "python automation", "python automation example", "python automation scripts examples", "automation python scripts", "automation python projects", "automation python"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "One Day Builds: Automating My Projects With Python", "description": "One Day Builds: Automating My Projects With Python\n\n\"Clean Code Friday\"\nIf you want to receive one short email from me every week, where I go through a few of the most useful things I have explored and discovered this week.
