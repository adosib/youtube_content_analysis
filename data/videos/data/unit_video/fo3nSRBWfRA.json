Hope everyone has enjoyed their break and is ready to get back into coding mode.  For today's lesson, I'll go over how to implement image zooming when tapping one of the cells in our chat controller.  The animation will perhaps look quite advanced when seeing it for the first time.  Fortunately its not that hard to implement as long as you break it down into little mini steps.
