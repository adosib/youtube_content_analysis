This tutorial will show you how to code ascii art in java.\n\nI like to take a break from learning and just program something that I enjoy. As a kid I've always loved ascii art.

I really enjoy making videos like this so I'll probably do a lot more project tutorials like this one :)\n\nDo you want to learn how to code from scratch?
