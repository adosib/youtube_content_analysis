In today's video I'll list out my top 10 reasons why I don't use storyboards.  Let the flame begin...\n\n10. Difficulty in laying out views that are stacked\n9. IBOutlet & IBAction crashes when refactoring\n8. Cell Identifiers and Storyboard Id strings are unsafe\n7. Compile time for complicated storyboards increases\n6. Refactoring all fonts in Storyboard components take too long\n5. Productivity decrease when hands leave the keyboard\n4. Screen size on laptop too small for storyboards\n3. Difficult to record and explain things on storyboard\n2. Teaching beginner iOS programmers what is exactly going on is difficult with storyboards.\n1. Merge conflicts will drive you crazy.\n\nHope everyone enjoys my short list of why I prefer not to use storyboards.
