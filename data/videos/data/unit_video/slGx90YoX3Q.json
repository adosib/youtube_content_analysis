We will accomplish this by introducing our second model object to the project: Tweet.  This object will hold information such as User and the tweet message string.\n\nTo render out the text easily with one UITextView component, I'll demonstrate how to use NSAttributedString to format our strings according to the designs.  This is a really efficient way of reducing the amount of components that are inside your cell subviews.\n\nEnjoy.\n\niOS Basic Training Course:\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/basic-training\n\nCompleted Source Code\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=832\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/buildthatapp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slGx90YoX3Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slGx90YoX3Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slGx90YoX3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slGx90YoX3Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slGx90YoX3Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Lets Build That App", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "development", "tutorial", "learn", "xcode", "programming", "code"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Swift 3: Twitter - Tweets String Formatting Tips And Tricks with NSAttributedString (Ep 9)", "description": "Let's turn our attention to further fleshing out the design for out Tweet cells today.
