Pramp sessions usually last about an hour so then you have an extra hour in between  to work on anything else.\nDuring that time I would alternate between solving a leetcode problem or watching an episode of MIT open course ware algorithms lectures specifically the lectures by Eric Demaine. Watching one of these lectures per day while doing the problems really helps solidify your understanding of algorithm and data structures fundamentals. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb\n\nI'd also recommend doing some of HackerRank's interview preparation guide questions.\nhttps://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit\nAnd what I also did was brush up on my Java through HackerRank's java problems.\nI think doing a variety of things during your day and actually doing mock interviews really helps shape your understanding of the material rather than doing strictly leetcode problems.\n\nWhen you're actually doing the problems I would recommend starting with binary search, then Linked List problems, then Tree problems. Those seemed like the easiest problems for me. I would also recommend sorting leetcode in order of difficulty (easy first) and top 100 interview questions. Do the problems that seem like common problems and have a lot of likes. When you're comfortable with easy move on to medium.\n\nAnd last but not least, once you do a problem you might forget about it in a few days. So I would honestly suggest doing problems on different sites like leetcode, hackerrank, codesignal, etc. because you will run into a ton of the same problems and it will help drill these concepts and solutions into your brain.\nThis obviously seems like a lot of stuff but I did it over the course of 2-3 months so if you're interviewing next week well then yeah maybe just do leetcode. If you have the time, I really believe that this strategy is great for getting fundamental concepts down. \n\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/NicholasWhit...\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/nick_white?al...\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/matrixman\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/NickWhiteCod...\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/nicholaswwhite\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/nickwwhite\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-...\nGithub - https://github.com/white105\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/2f2Tgy3\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/nickiswhite", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmf-oObylnk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmf-oObylnk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmf-oObylnk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmf-oObylnk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmf-oObylnk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Nick White", "tags": ["google", "uber", "how to", "tutorial", "technical interviews", "interviews", "software engineering", "computer science", "coding interview", "algorithms", "data structures", "whiteboarding", "cracking the coding interview", "leetcode", "study guide", "pramp", "hackerrank", "coding", "programming", "science", "math", "advise", "jobs", "internships"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How I Passed My Technical Interviews at Uber & Google - Software Engineering", "description": "Exactly how I passed my technical interviews at Google and Uber\nLike I said in my last post, use Pramp.\n\nPramp allows you to schedule interviews from 11am to 11pm every 2 hours.
