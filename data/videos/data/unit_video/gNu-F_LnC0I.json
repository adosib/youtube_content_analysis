The solution is to use a while loop and reverse out pointers. However, because the implementation is a little difficult to follow, let's first go through how we can print out all the nodes first.  \n\nI will then walk through how the reverse implementation changes the structure of our list. Finally, we'll see what our reversed head node becomes.\n\nFacebook Group\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1240636442694543/\n\niOS Basic Training Course\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/basic-training\n\nCompleted Source Code\nhttps://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=932\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/buildthatapp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNu-F_LnC0I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNu-F_LnC0I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNu-F_LnC0I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNu-F_LnC0I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNu-F_LnC0I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Lets Build That App", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "development", "tutorial", "learn", "xcode", "programming", "code", "interview", "algorithm", "linkedlist", "linked", "list", "pointer", "node", "next", "reverse"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Interview Algorithm Challenge: Reverse Linked List - Swift", "description": "Today, let's go over a very common interview question that's asked and it is to reverse a singly linked list.
